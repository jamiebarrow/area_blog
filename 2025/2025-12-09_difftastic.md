# 2025-12-09 - difftastic

```shell
$ winget install --id Wilfred.difftastic
```

Difftastic is a really nice diffing tool which makes use of a semantic diff experience.
It relies on treesitter as a parser and can recognize languages that treesitter understands.
Due to this, it doesn't just do diffs based on string differences, but on syntax aware differences.

It also supports coloured output in the terminal as well as a side-by-side view, which I find fantastic.

It has become my default difftool in git.
