# Modernizing Legacy Systems: Maintain your IT Garden

You often hear it: software development is like building a house.
But that comparison doesn't always hold.
A house remains the same for years, while software constantly evolves.
A garden is a better metaphor.

In a garden, you need to prune, fertilize, remove weeds, and consider the seasons.
The same applies to your IT landscape.

Many organizations still work with outdated software.
These legacy systems suffer from slow performance, vulnerable security, and inconvenient dependencies on old hardware or programming languages.
Modernization is not a luxury but a necessity.

## Why Change is Necessary

Legacy may sound negative, but it is also an inheritance: the system has served the company well for years.
However, past success does not guarantee future performance.
If you don't change anything, the next five years will look the same as the last five - and that's rarely enough in IT.

Technological _and_ business changes demand adaptation.
Just as a garden needs different care each season, your software environment requires flexibility.
Think about the need for scaling, improved performance, or compliance with privacy regulations.

In many cases, retraining employees _and_ updating existing software is cheaper and more efficient than rebuilding everything from scratch.
But if a system is fundamentally flawed, rebuilding may be the only option.

## What is a Legacy System?

A system is considered legacy when it is built in older languages like COBOL or C++, runs on specific (often discontinued) hardware, and is difficult to maintain.

Even newer systems and software that are 5-10 years old, such as .NET Framework, NodeJS or Java, can be considered legacy if they are difficult to maintain or integrate.

Common problems include:

- Poor performance and slow response times
- Security vulnerabilities due to outdated memory management
- Dependence on old infrastructure
- Difficulty integrating with modern systems
- High costs and extensive manual processes

## The Power of Modern Platforms

At ShareValue, we help organizations modernize their legacy systems without disrupting everything.
By migrating to modern, platform-independent technology (such as .NET, Java, Docker, Kubernetes), you gain more flexibility and scalability.
Programming languages like Python, C#, and JavaScript make integration easier and maintenance more manageable.

And importantly: many organizations already use modern technologies like Java alongside older systems like COBOL.
In such a hybrid situation, good system design is crucial.
Technology is only part of the solution - simplicity and documentation make the real difference in maintainability.

## Managing Complexity

Modern software environments often resemble a web of interdependencies.
Tools like Terraform and Bicep help manage infrastructure as code.
Standard APIs and cloud platforms accelerate development.
But how do you maintain oversight in this "digital forest"?

The answer lies in observability: measuring and analyzing system performance, interactions, and behavior.
By using tools like JMeter, k6, Serilog, Application Insights, or OpenTelemetry, you gain insights into:

- API response times
- Stability under load (soak and stress tests)
- Security vulnerabilities through simulation testing
- User behavior and bottlenecks (using tools like Hotjar or Google Analytics)

This data helps you make informed decisions and improve effectively.
Just like in a garden, you need to observe and measure before knowing what to adjust.

## Choose Secure and Maintainable Code

Modern programming languages also help improve security and maintainability structurally.
Consider:

- **C#** with nullable reference types (since version 8.0), preventing common errors like null reference exceptions
- **Kotlin**, with clear syntax and Java integration, making legacy migrations easier
- **Rust**, which guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector - ideal for sensitive environments like blockchain and IoT

Using modern languages prevents common bugs and reduces your software's attack surface.

## Prevent Overgrowth

Unmaintained software code turns into a tangled mess.
Tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle, and CodeCharta help you visualize complexity.
By measuring cyclomatic complexity or monitoring test coverage, you stay in control of quality.

However, be mindful: more measurement is not always better.
Principles like Goodhart's Law, Amdahl's Law, and Brooke's Law remind us not to overdo it.
A good balance between measuring and improving is essential.

## Documentation as the Foundation

A good garden starts with fertile soil - and in software, that means documentation.
Ensure that knowledge about processes and systems is easy to find.
Tools like Confluence or Markdown help with this.
Even simple steps like measuring reading time can improve engagement from readers and users.
