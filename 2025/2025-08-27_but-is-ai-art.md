# But is AI Art?

I was asked [this question](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366141141781467136?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7366141141781467136%2C7366143041759256578%29&replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7366141141781467136%2C7366433484489359360%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287366143041759256578%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7366141141781467136%29&dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287366433484489359360%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7366141141781467136%29) recently on LinkedIn and I thought it was worth writing something in a longer form to air my thoughts around the matter:

> There has been a big debate on whether AI created works should be considered art.
> Some see it as cheating, others see it as an enhancement to their natural artistic ability.
> How much of your art is giving the AI a prompt, and how much is from your imagination/talent?
> Like do you get hands on with a digitizer tablet on the AI's output before you show it to the public?

Ever since I can remember, there has been the debate: "But is it Art?".

In my opinion, there is no objective answer to that question.
If we define "Art" as a creative expression, then anything deemed creative can be deemed as an artwork.
Even a banana being duct taped to a wall can be viewed as an artpiece, as it is something that was created by applying materials to produce something.
It could be observed, it could be talked about, it could raise questions and speak to the values and principles of people and cause discussion around it.

Is it lazy? I have no idea, perhaps it took a tremendous amount of time and thought to create such a simple yet provocative piece. In the end, that's subjective thinking.

Is it effective? Considering the amount of talk around the piece, and the countless mimics of it, I would say it has been a very effective piece of art.

That in the end is another outcome of an artpiece: conversation, thought, philosophy, discussion.

In primary and high school I did art as a subject.
The only thing I remember from my primary school art teachers is how the one didn't like my way of using shading and rubbing the paper to create more realistic and smooth drawings in pencil. How he told me that the great artists would never do that, they would draw with clear straight lines to build up their masterpieces. I personally disagreed with him, but I think it did influence me to draw less. I even skipped art for a year in high school, doing French instead perhaps because I wasn't confident in myself, or maybe because I thought I could get better marks in it after receiving an A in the first year of high school. We did get another teacher in primary school who prefered doing more crafts, like making candles, sewing, and doing more than just drawing or painting.

Back then I was already playing around with tools like the shareware version of Paint Shop Pro. I heard from others what is possible with Photoshop, and how you needed an Apple Mac to use it, but I had Windows computers, and only free tools. Paint Shop Pro, Corel Draw, whatever else was going around on the shareware CD's at the time, or whatever came with the PC. I did enjoy playing around with all the filters, and doing tutorials, but I could never really create what I had in my mind. I remember trying to do some clouds using the smudge tool with a mouse, which was quite fulfilling, but in the end, still didn't feel quite like the clouds I was imagining in my mind.

I stuck to traditional art. Pencil drawing was it for me, I enjoyed the control you could have over the shading and darkness using HB versus 2B and so on.

In high school, we were taught more theory of art which I guess was already coming natural to me.
How the composition of a drawing is not just about what you draw, but also about what you decide to leave as empty space.
That too creates the composition, and the lines in the image can lead the viewer through the artwork.

Of course, this was also taught in the history of art and architecture.
In 1998, my first year of high school, my teacher thought I was a prodigy and tried to encourage me to pursue art in the next year, but I chose French instead.

I still remember the one project we were given, the topic of which I now forget, but I think it was that we had to make use of the flag in our drawing. I believe we also had to make use of coloured pencils. I was enjoying doing interesting optical illusions, tribal kind of tatoos, 3D kinds of shapes like the pipes screensaver in Windows 95. This time I wanted to make a kind of 3D illusion, with three flags, each one getting smaller. But, I also wanted to make out as if it was a jigsaw puzzle, and had also a repeated pattern so that none of the shapes would touch each other, and so it would give a nice border around each flag but also give an interesting shape in-between the actual puzzle pieces, since only the pieces would be coloured in the various colours of the South African flag.

Turns out, after I had finished my project and handed it in, that the teacher really thought it was something special.
I wasn't sure why.

But later on, I found out that there was an American artist named Jasper Johns who created a piece called Three Flags, of the American flag, which also had three flags overlapping each other, with a kind of 3D effect due to the shadows (similar to what I chose to do).

I had never seen the image, so for me it was quite the coincidence.
Perhaps I had seen it in a cartoon - like seeing Salvador Dali's Persistence of Memory in Disney cartoons like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck, if memory serves me right.
Perhaps it was subconcious, but I for sure was not thinking of this artwork when I was creating my own.

One could likely put the two together, see which was created first, and then declare the one as a blatant copy.
But I would have extreme trouble accepting that, because I know the truth of the matter.
It was my own art, with my own thinking, and my own execution.
Plus, it isn't even a copy, it adds another distinct element with the use of the jigsaw pieces.
The rest is pure coincidence; they're two independent artworks with likely two different inspirations that just seem similar.

I took art until the end of high school, and when it came to choosing a university degree, it was going to be between becoming a Graphic Designer or a Computer Scientist. Those were the two options I had in my mind, and I figured the Computer Science path would be a better choice financially, and I went that route.

Web development has always interested me, especially the visual aspect of it, because it also brings me a creative outlet.
Being able to choose compositions, colours, and I guess these days effects and animations, can be quite rewarding.

I do also enjoy solving puzzles, I always have loved games, boardgames, puzzles, quizzes and things that test my brain.
I used to really enjoy maths, and in primary school participated in the maths olympiads each year.
I enjoyed it a bit less in high school, but I think that came down to the teachers of the 1st set.
I started in the first set of maths, but went down to the second set, and stayed there.
Thankfully so, because one of my favourite teachers would be my final maths teacher in high school.

I also would go on to do a lot of mathematical subjects in university, alongside the Computer Science subjects: Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Economics. I ended up not really enjoying Economics, and ditched that after 1st year, but I continued Maths and Computer Science until 3rd year, and Applied Maths to 2nd year. I ended up doing my Honours year afterwards in Computer Science.

During my studies, we also had an Artificial Intelligence course.
I still remember the day one of my classmates that I considered friends at the time, who was very interested in music and playing guitar, decided to complete the one AI project doing research in the more creative space of AI: generating art or music using AI.

At the time, I was also still into drawing. I suppose at the time, I was not the most social person, and kept to myself.
Art was a way of expressing myself on paper, and I believe became a bit of a therapy for me.
I would often spend time in class and at home doodling.
Sometimes it would help me focus, to doodle in class, kind of how some people twiddle their fingers and thumbs to try to keep the brain active and engaged to improve concentration.
Sometimes I've had people see this and they think I'm not paying attention, but the opposite is true - it used to enhance my experience... otherwise I'd likely fall asleep from boredom, haha!

On late nights at home when I was feeling lonely, it would be an escape from my own thoughts.
I used to draw in pen, because I like the permanence of that.
It became a challenge, and made the commitment more real.
Either it meant you don't draw a line because you would risk making a mistake to the artwork,
or you would draw without thinking of what will come, because it could always evolve into a surprising element of something you didn't even imagine you would create when you drew that line.
Many artists often just drawing randomly on paper, and then start adding detail into the shapes that appear, and then form an artpiece from there.

That's what I enjoyed doing.
Similar to creative writing, or interpretive dance, where there's maybe not even a theme, you just start to start, and see where the wind takes you.
If it takes you in circles, and doesn't lead anywhere... that's fine too.
It's more about the process, than the actual end result.

I used to sometimes scan in my blue or black pen drawings into the computer, and share them with others on deviantART.
Sometimes for advice, where I'd then make some changes and then send the next revision for more feedback.
Most times, just to feel good about myself I guess - it's always nice to receive positive feedback.

But there were also times where I thought that maybe I could turn these into actual artworks.
dA had features to take your artwork and feature them to the community, which could open doors as an artist.
I had a kind of hope that I could be an artist as a side hustle, and still do computer programming.
The best of both worlds.

It would at times be a bit tedious, because I would scan in the drawing at as high resolution as our home all-in-one printer could do.
At the time, my sister also had a printing business where she would print artists' works on canvas for them, either because the artists themselves
wanted to sell it, or because the artist had a commission. She would scan in the microfish/microfilm negatives, do clean up in Photoshop on the Mac,
sort out the colour profiles in the Windows computer which was connected to the giant canvas printer in the other room. This was maybe even while I was still in high school, and in those days everything was slow. Not like today. To save an image, it would take maybe half an hour to save the Gigabytes of storage to disk. Then if you ran out of disk space, you would burn it to a DVD, which hopefully the image would fit on, otherwise you may have to edit it to save space without losing any quality. My sister might have had techniques to split one image across multiple DVD's, but she's not always the most computer savvy, so I doubt that.

I didn't use her scanner, I just used the all-in-one printer, likely some cheap Epson or HP printer. I wasn't dealing with gigabyte sized images. I just wanted something that looked nice on a computer screen.

deviantART did have a print shop, but nobody ever wanted to buy my prints.

My friends in university had a band, so I designed their CD cover. I did it from scratch using my Wacom tablet. It was one of the kinds where you plugged it in via USB, but you had to get used to not looking at where you are drawing. These days, you have iPads and reMarkable tablets, and even Wacom products, where you can draw on the screen and see in real time what you're drawing. Back then, if you wanted to draw a line, you may have to undo quite a few attempts before you got it right. Layers were your friend.

I would debate with other users on deviantART chat that traditional art is a "truer" art form than digital art, because of all these things that helped someone on a computer. Layers for example. At our end of school dance, I was asked to help paint the entrance hall to the dance with an underwater theme. I felt quite honoured to be asked, but when we got there, anyone could really paint out the shapes because they used the trick of having the shapes drawn on a plastic film and used an overhead projector to project them onto the walls we were going to be painting. That felt like it was cheating a bit - you didn't have to be an artist to do it, anybody could have helped them out. I still felt honoured to be asked, but I felt then that they just needed people to help them, and anyone could have, not just fellow art students.

I guess that's similar to using layers in Photoshop. Is it cheating?

Well, I don't know. I guess its just using tools to help you out.
Is using an easel to hold your canvas up cheating? No, its just a tool.
Is mixing your own colours together a more pure form of art, than just buying a tube that has the pre-mixed colour?

I guess it is subjective.

Back to the AI project in university. My friend had decided to research AI that could be used in making artwork.
He realized, that there were already projects where machines had been used to create paintings.
For example, Jackson Pollock is a well known abstract expressionist painter, known for his drip technique.
Some people may question if his artworks are really art, or just lazy - he's just pouring paint on a canvas, anyone can do that.

I believe it is art, and I also read somewhere that if you look at all his paintings, even though they seem to have been created randomly,
there is a certain pattern and stylistic element that is uniquely Jackson Pollock, and so it may seem quite random, but there is an underlying
pattern that likely Pollock himself wasn't even aware of.

Now, it was either Pollock's works or others, but my friends research came across a robotic system which would basically shoot paint from
paint jets at a canvas, each one being a different colour. The timing and the shapes could be randomized, and artwork could be generated from
this system. There would be no real thought in the way this painting was being done, no real theme, story, or idea. Just random painting.

Is that creative?

Now, in my opinion, the answer to that is subjective.

But a similar question comes around to "What is creative?" as "What is intelligence?".

There are the thought experiments of the Chinese Room, and of the Turing Test. Both aim to try and reach a philosophical stance on intelligence.

With the Chinese Room, imagine that you're stuck inside of a room and you can't see outside of the room. You do have a big rulebook that explains how you can reply to messages you receive. Outside of the room, are Chinese speaking people. They cannot see inside of the room, and have no idea who or what is inside the room. They can send messages to you and receive your answers. You have absolutely no knowledge of Chinese, perhaps you've never even seen a single Chinese letter or symbol before. All you do is receive a message, check the rulebook how to respond, and then respond back to them.

To the people standing outside of the room, it seems as if they're speaking with someone fluent in Chinese. However, that is not the case. You appear to understand the language, but you do not understand the language.

With the Turing Test, it is a similar kind of thought experiment. If a person communicates with two parties, one being a human and one being a computer, but the person believes that they are speaking to two people, or rather, the person cannot tell which one is the computer, then the computer has passed the Turing Test.

With these two thought experiments in mind... what is intelligence?

Is the person inside the room intelligent... or are they just following rules without really understanding? One could argue, they successfully achieve the goals expected of them, but without true understanding, and so they are not intelligent.

With the Turing Test, it could be the same. Just because a computer is behaving as if it were a human, is it really a human? Is it really thinking the same way that a human thinks?

Personally, I believe that we as humans don't even fully understand how we think... so, the answer to this one is not so clear.

For all we know, we could be created by a divine creator, and we're just following the rules set out for as by that creator.
Everything we do, makes us feel like we're intelligent, but in fact, that's just how we've been designed.
We're then not intelligent, we just like to think we are.
But we cannot understand enough of how we were created to truly know if we're intelligent or designed.

Similarly, is the machine that spits out paint in random patterns being creative, or is it just following rules?

One of the underlying principles of creation, and human intelligence, is that we can take all of our past experiences and knowledge, and then create something new and something that was never experienced or created before - at least to our knowledge.

With the Three Flags example I gave earlier, the fact that two different people created the same thing, does not disqualify that these were independant events unknown to each other. If however, I did get inspired unknowingly through some TV program or an image in a magazine that I didn't conciously pick up, but my subconcious did store in the depths of my brain... then perhaps I was not being truly creative and was influenced by a predecessor. Combining the new visual elements and the past Three Flags image though, could still be taking existing knowledge and creating something that was not independant, but inspired and new.

An argument against AI generated art is the idea of copyright.
What is copying?
If an AI generates a new artwork, but bases it on previous works, and does not cite the original as a reference, then it is deemed as unfairly copying - at least in my understanding.

I believe this is where the grey line is with AI generated art: was the image a new creation, inspired by previous works, or was it a blatant copy without referencing the original artist. In that case, perhaps commissions should be going towards that artist if it is involved in commercial practices, for example.

My personal view is that AI generated art is indeed creation. Yes, it may be random, but likely there is a pattern in there we don't understand which gives it its own unique taste of randomness - just as with Jackson Pollock.

With MidJourney, providing a prompt is like providing an artist a topic to create an artwork from. MidJourney can do this in seconds to minutes. Review of that can be done, and the prompt adjusted, the randomness paramters tweaked, perhaps a different model chosen with the same prompt, or variations along the same theme - both subtle, and strong variations. The resulting images that are generated serve as a creation, but do not always end up being the final product.

Personally, I don't really touch up what has been created by MidJourney, but I can see this also being a rewarding experience. Like cutting pictures out of magazines and creating a collage - is this cheating? Or is it just using tools to create new artworks? I would say, its just using tools as part of a creative process.

Often I have a concept in mind, which starts off as one prompt in MidJourney, but ends up in a completely different line of thinking and on a completely different path of creative expression to what I had intended initially. You can mask parts of a generated image to try and refine it, or zoom out to see if perhaps this is just one part of a greater scene - almost opposite to how one would review a grand master, where you see a giant painting in front of you and zoom in to look at the detail. In my mind, it is like the photograph, which changed the way artists began to paint. Before photographs were invented, paintings didn't really focus on rectangular scenes, or have parts of the scene cut off like you would get with a photograph. Was that a backward leap in artistry - nope, not in my view.

But now I realize, I have been typing for a while. I've probably bored you with all of this, and I should get back to the question I was originally faced with.

> There has been a big debate on whether AI created works should be considered art.

There will always be debate as to if artworks are really art, regardless of how they are created. I feel this will always be subjective and so there's no real objective way to measure it, just as there's no objective way to define how we as human beings have been created.

> Some see it as cheating, others see it as an enhancement to their natural artistic ability.

Some see using layers in Photoshop as cheating... some see cutting pictures out of magazines for collages as cheating... maybe even buying a canvas instead of stretching it yourself... purists can be pure, but that shouldn't detract the others "doing" from what they're doing.

> How much of your art is giving the AI a prompt, and how much is from your imagination/talent?

I would say that it depends on the idea. Sometimes after a single prompt and generation, it is exactly what I wanted, but more often than not, it is just the beginning of an iterative creative process, and often what is generated changes my own idea and vision entirely; in terms of imagination, I would say its a combination, in terms of talent, well, I also can't paint a Michelangelo, but I also wouldn't judge him for painting his artworks with brushes instead of just finger painting... different tools require different talents.


> Like do you get hands on with a digitizer tablet on the AI's output before you show it to the public?

I could, but no, I don't at this moment. Perhaps in the future I will though.

One thing I do really enjoy, is the creative process that MidJourney has given me. It allows me to really create pieces I imagine, in record time. The fast turnaround time has been a huge boost. Likely, if I really practiced, I could create one of the images it generates. Maybe it would take years to get there. I know even with not really drawing in pen and pencil for a long time since I started working, that my own skill level there and patience, and available time to put towards this craft, is not what it was when I was in high school. And so that's why I see it as really a great tool in the toolbox of an artist.

I know as well, that I could likely even make it faster. I could script it, automate it, remove my own self and save myself time by just letting it generate from the first prompt or generate like 10 variations a day and I just pick the best one from that, and then it goes and posts on my behalf. But I don't. I read each day a quote from a tear off calendar. The calendar is in Dutch, so I first translate it, either myself as a learning opportunity, or using Google Translate (or both). Then, maybe I don't believe its a real quote, and I do some small research around that - is it really a quote, is it just an attribution, what is the history around it? Sometimes that feeds into my theme for the picture I want to create. Sometimes I spend more time researching the topic, than generating the image. Sometimes, the other way around. This in my opinion, is also my own self being put into the process.

Is it art? Definitely.

Is it creative? Definitely.

Is it satisfying and fulfilling? Definitely.

In the end, AI art is still art. It may use different tools, but so have all artists throughout history. It is really just a medium. Whether it's papyrus, paper, plastic, brushes, cameras, Photoshop, or MidJourney, what matters most is the creative process, the intention behind it, and the conversation it sparks. For me, it is definitely art - creative, satisfying, and deeply fulfilling.
