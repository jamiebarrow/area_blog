# 2025-09-03 - Ramblings on productivity and focus

Yesterday I attended a Meetup titled ["How to maintain focus in a world of distractions"](https://www.meetup.com/cm-tech-breda-meetups/events/310387563/). It was hosted by CM.com at their head office in Breda, and was presented by [Marco Leijtens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcoleijtens), a neuropsychologist and focus expert who teaches at the University of Amsterdam.

I thoroughly enjoyed the session, because I've always been interested in this kind of topic. I am someone who used to be able to focus extremely well on a task, sometimes so well that I would focus too much and forget about other important tasks. Or the opposite, where I would struggle to keep my focus and motivation going, and procrastinate until it "felt right" to start. To start when I was "in the zone".

Often I believe I have ADHD, or I jokingly say "without the H", because I can also be very lazy and not so energetic. Though, I've mentioned this to professionals at times who affirm me I don't have ADHD. I sometimes beg to differ... but anyway, I'm now drifting away from the point.

For many years I have looked at various techniques and tools related to focus, or more specifically to organization systems and personal knowledge management systems.

Getting Things Done, 43 folders, Inbox Zero, Eisenhower Matrix, Pomodoro Technique, Personal Kanban, Bullet Journaling, Time Trackers (e.g. Grindstone), Habit Trackers, Mood Trackers, Health Trackers (e.g. Huawei Smart Band), Zettelkasten, PARA Method, EverNote, OneNote, Notion, Obsidian.

Likely there are many, many more that I don't list, which I have looked into and tried. I also still have an Inkscape SVG which I created of a mock-up UI for my own time tracker I wanted to build, Timeblocks, which I still keep re-starting from scratch, and have never completed.

In the past year or so, I decided to narrow down and focus on all of these. What works for me? What doesn't?

I looked deeper into the Zettelkasten method and came across the content of [Mischa van den Burg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mischavandenburg/) who also explained the PARA Method and the use of these with Obsidian. I enjoyed it so much, and it spoke to me so much, that I joined his paid-for skool.com community, [KubeCraft](https://www.skool.com/kubecraft/about), to really go into the details of his own system, as an inspiration to my own system(s). The Kubernetes knowledge in the community was a bonus.

I had looked into the Bullet Journaling technique when I first moved to the Netherlands in 2018. I remember watching the YouTube introduction video on my laptop during a summer evening in an apartment in Tilburg. I had seen the video before, but never tried the method properly. I decided to do so. I bought a journal specifically for this. I tried it, and enjoyed it at the start. But, it just didn't stick.

In the past, I had tried GTD, making specific folders and categories and filters in Outlook to try to put the Do-Delegate-Defer processes in action. It worked to some extent, with a combination of Eisenhower Matrix categories to identify what was urgent or not, important or not. This was inspired by a tip I saw in one of [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)'s blogs or videos. But in the end, I went back to a pretty ad-hoc process. Still getting to Inbox Zero, but in my own ways.

I tried EverNote, OneNote and Notion, all to various successes. But nothing ever really felt like it fit me perfectly.

With the Pomodoro technique it was the same. I used Grindstone for time tracking, but it would pop up an alert that the timer had finished, and I just started getting into the flow of things... this little interruption ironically taking me out of it. I tried Windows apps, Android apps, iPhone apps, web apps. I tried to just use a physical timer and paper. But, I would forget to stop timing, and still get distracted anyway. I also tried the TODO+ extension for Visual Studio Code, which I saw an old colleague using to great effect. These were all nice. But there was always something slightly off, something missing.

I came across the concept of the 5 types of wealth: time, social, physical health, mental health, finance. Previously I had also decided on time buckets as explained by [John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sVGJXG4ZFQ) - personal / family, work, health, project / hobby, sleep. I re-organized things according to these taxonomies. They worked well for a while. But sometimes things just didn't fit in one box.

At times I would spend more time thinking about the organization system, than actually being organized, and taking action on what I need to execute.

Now that Markdown is a very commonly used format for documentation, I've been using that more and more. And with Obsidian supporting Wikipedia like linking, keeping a "second brain" system with fleeting notes, blog ideas, project ideas, etc. all in one Git repository, I started to see an opportunity to really try and combine all these techniques again.

I've created my own Obsidian Vault, with tips and tricks learned from my own and others' experiences. I first gather everything new into a collection box, some people call this their Inbox. The PARA method of organization helps me to sort items into various buckets, along with the 5 types of wealth, time buckets, and Eisenhower Matrix. Maybe a specific one doesn't always apply, but that's fine. In general, they do assist in sorting into a specific bucket, and helping me keep mindful of priorities.

The Zettelkasten method focuses on writing quality notes. Instead of collecting a whole lot of resources, and placing them in a project file to come back to later when you want to write a piece on it, the idea is to process it it now and create a high quality piece of content. The resources used for that content may not even be needed anymore, because the knowledge is distilled into a small quality note. If they are going to be relevant, you can still keep them in a separate folder if you need to dig into the details later, but most likely you won't need to and will end up trashing it anyway.

Zettelkasten even has a less intuitive system in it - you don't care about organizing the notes. You just create an index to the note so it's easy to find later, and then place it in the note cupboard, and move on. Cross-referencing related notes as you find them. The time is focused not on organizing everything, but on output of quality notes. If it's going to become relevant again, you will spend less time fetching them because they're condensed to smaller distilled notes from your initial research time.

It reminds me a bit of when we would do a literature review during my honours year on university while working on a research project. Collecting resources and having references is great, but the notes you create on your own, based on learnings you had from the original references, are more important. Spending effort up-front saves time in the long run, as you're making use of the context you still have from reading the resource as soon as you've read it. The up-front effort takes longer in the short term, but allows you to complete things faster later on.

And that ironically brings me back to the Pomodoro technique. Pomodoro is a time boxing technique. It attempts to ensure that enough breaks are taken, to conserve energy and to make maximum effect of our natural attention spans. The official technique calls for 25 minute time blocks used for focused work. Any distractions you have, like a colleague interrupting you, or a sudden though to check your email, or look at your phone... all of these impulses shouldn't be ignored, but rather quickly taken note of, and deferred until a later stage.

This is to minimize the effects of context switching. After a 25 minute block, a short 5 minute break is done, to allow for the brain to switch away from a mode of taking action. Due to the physiology of the brain, it allows for creative thoughts to come, and for energy and attention to be maintained throughout the day. A perfect time for a meditation, or low focus tasks. After 4 time blocks, a larger 15 minute break is taken, or perhaps even longer for example an hour lunch break.

It's about maximizing the working memory you have, and to minimize the wasted efforts of having to re-read things later, remember what you were working on, and get back to that state you were in before your interruption. Writing the quality notes up-front, in a focused fashion, helps there.

Regarding the specific times, I never found these times to work for me. Just as I would get into a task, I would have to take a break. So I would also try out longer time blocks than 25 minutes, 1 hour or even 2 hour blocks, which would allow me to actually complete a task. This is very personal.

However, yesterday's talk mentioned the ultradian rhythm, which is typically 90 minute intervals, in which the attention span fluctuates. The common thinking is that a human can not really concentrate fully for an extended period of time, before they lose focus and attention. That's why in school we had periods that were never longer than 45 minutes each, with 5 or 15 minute breaks in-between to get from one class to another. In high school it was longer than in primary school.

As our biology changes, a lot of this likely fluctuates too. Take into account the circadian rhythm, the amounts of cortisol, melatonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, hormones, vitamins, etc. that are in our body at any point in time.. this can vary not only person to person, but also for an individual from day to day or hour to hour.

This was made popular by Andrew Huberman in the [Huberman Lab](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) podcast, but these concepts were also explained in yesterday's meetup.

I have had times in my life where I went through burnout and depression. Loud noises become less tolerable, especially in crowded rooms. Energy levels fluctuate even more. The body doesn't produce the same amounts of hormones as it used to. Medication and lifestyle changes are necessary to keep the body in balance, even more than normal.

Exercise, sleep and meditation were pointed out by Marco. Nutrition is also quite obvious with the Mediterranean diet and the Smile diet are two well known diets to aid those that battle with the effects of depression. Knowing your family history can also be useful in directing you, perhaps there are thyroid imbalances or issues related to inflammation which can affect these as well.

Habit tracking, tracking of calories, what foods you eat, when you go to bed, when you go to sleep, etc. etc. etc.

It's a lot of admin that I don't really want to do. So I don't :D But, I do take certain things at certain times in my life, and make use of them at that point. A mini-project: lets track our sleep this month; lets track our weight for the next two weeks while on a diet, etc.

Making a small change, seeing how it affects you, not only for a couple of days, but for two weeks, is something that I recommend. It's very easy to start something new. It's very difficult to make that a daily habit, and even harder to make it part of your lifestyle.

Most of the things we do in our day, are likely even done automatically. We don't think of "Oh, I have to breathe in now", and we don't get afraid that we're falling when we're taking the next step on the ground... but, maybe in the past that is something our bodies experienced and got used to. As we got older, we didn't need to be actively thinking about it, as it become second nature, and subconscious.

It's about making the best of all the conscious and subconscious decisions in our day to day life, and then optimizing those where possible. Maybe not even optimizing it, just making it a little bit better or bearable.

A model of the different networks in our brains were explained: Default Mode Network, Fronto-Parietal Network, Salience Network. These were explained as the Dreamer, the CEO and the Moderator. The CEO being responsible for executive functions, focused complex work. The Dreamer being the more creative and abstract thinker. The Moderator would be responsible for deciding whether the Dreamer or CEO were in control at any point in time, and switching between the two. Plus a final one - the Guard, who would ring the alarm bells in the case of an emergency that needed immediate response. The Dreamer has the most access to the subconscious mind, and the CEO with the conscious mind. 

These are of course important to productivity. Making sure we get enough sleep, have adequate nutrition, and take enough breaks can ensure our energy levels don't get disrupted. Disruption here could cause issues with the entire body.

Being overstimulated could keep us in a constant state of emergency - the Guard could be on the lookout all the time, exhausting. I felt this in my home country of South Africa, where I was constantly paranoid and on-edge in certain situations due to past experiences. Or after my burnout, as others experience, where sitting in a room full of loud noises makes it incredibly difficult to focus, making you want to leave the room and find a calm of silence again.

Similarly, when the energy was low, and I didn't really want to socialize, and I wanted to stay in bed all day, that allowed for my Dreamer to be in a state of inner-over-stimulation - rumination, replaying past bad experiences, overthinking about future tasks, circling in negative emotions.

All of this could have effected my motivation - an underactive CEO, unable to start a task, or starting a task, but getting stuck and not persevering through, but switching back to an inner-voice of self-sabotage, and moving onto the next easy task which maybe also never got completed, ending the day looking at an incomplete todo list of failures. Not very motivating.

Likely, until diagnosed and treated for depression, the Moderator having a tough time knowing when to switch away from the Dreamer and let the CEO take action - or vice versa, hyper-focusing on tasks to avoid switching back to the negative imaginings of the Dreamer.

Of course, when this is all in balance, or at least closer to being in balance, the opposite is true. Finishing tasks with ease, or looking back on the tough projects with a feeling of happiness and pride - drilling those four holes into the house, so we could bolt the outside table to the wall... with a drill that had a hammer action, but maybe not strong enough... I wanted to stop, until the week after, but I had a break and during that break, the neighbour offered his industrial strength drill, and I completed the job.

The dopamine and adrenaline likely increased. I didn't have to ruminate on the project anymore. Seeing the bench sitting inside instead of outside would no longer be stimulus giving me a feeling of guilt.

It was energizing, onto the next task!

Now, bringing this back into the productivity systems.

The idea of GTD, Inbox Zero, 43 folders, and Zettelkasten are to collect all of your items into one place, process them quickly using an almost automatable process, and then spend your attention and focus on actually taking action on things that matter.

Defer, Delegate, schedule the things that don't matter now, to later. Similarly with distracitons during a Pomodoro - write it down, and continue with what you were busy with. While the CEO part of the brain is working, don't interrupt him and let the Dreamer take control. Schedule the Dreamer for the end of the time box, let them wait their turn.

This builds up a habit, and a discipline, that eventually may become second nature. Yes, initially it is hard - just as a baby trying to walk for the first time is hard, and how a toddler trying to run a race is hard, and a teenager trying to do a triathlon is hard, and just as an adult trying to run a marathon is hard... each level, is hard at that point in time. But it becomes easier as time goes by. If the baby doesn't struggle with walking, they may not eventually become the adult that trains and struggles to complete their marathon. It all starts with baby steps.

I've also been practicing a bit of another technique that stood out to me yesterday, while writing this article: vomiting on paper. Now, it's not as gross as it sounds... it can be described as just writing on paper whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about what you've written, just keep writing. Get it all out. Don't worry about cleaning it up now, that can happen later. Don't try to remember when you ate those carrots, I mean, when you wrote down that fleeting note or who gave you the movie suggestion you wrote down, or how you explained the concept of the modes of the brain correctly or not. Just write. It's the start of a creative process. The CEO's time to do the complex task of editing, simplifying, formatting, etc. will come later, but let the Dreamer do their work. Maybe its a team effort, that's also fine. But remember to take breaks in between, instead of spending 2 hours writing a bunch of garbage, it's fine to spend 15 minutes, take a quick break, come back to the piece, and finish it later.

Personally, I just decided to get it all done in like 2 hours of spewing out this article. But, hopefully its a decent enough quality. Whatever works for you.

I'll likely come back at a later stage, refine this, reflect on what I wrote, see what's good, see what's not, and then keep the parts I like and ditch the parts I don't. Maybe splitting it into a series of articles?

That's what I did recently. I revisited the technique of Bullet Journaling. When I bought my reMarkable Paper Pro, I bought it with the intention to use it to actually write things in a tactile way. I tried the iPad before, but it wasn't as nice as writing on paper. Paper is great, but it leaves a lot of stuff in the office or home, and that leads to more stuff I need to organize in a physical space. I prefer to have it digital, as the effort to organize digital things is a lot less for me than the effort to organize physical things.

There's a saying, the source of which I forget, but which I always remember: "You don't need more space, you need less stuff".

Getting to Inbox Zero, getting to an organized Project folder, having the various Areas in my life in order, and keeping tabs on how and why I spent my time, help me to live a balanced life.

And that's the most important valuable thing you can take out of this: what is your goal?

My goal is to maintain a balance in my life.

Productivity systems and knowledge management systems should allow me in this goal.

If I'm spending way too much time on this, and not enough time next to my wife, this is a big sign that there is improvement to be made.

My writing here is two fold: it's a nice way of journaling, and keeping track of what I've done; it's also a nice learning resource, that can hopefully help others in their own goals.

I hope that you've read this, and found something of value in it. Thank you!

Maybe I even process it later, and make it a better resource in the end. Only time can tell.
